            in a legally binding way. Capitalized words are defined in the relevant dedicated section of this document.


            The User must read this document carefully.

            Nothing in these Terms creates any relationship of employment, agency, or partnership between the involved
            parties.

            "This Website" refers to

            the Service;
            The following documents are incorporated by reference into these Terms:

            Data Processing Agreement/Service Provider Agreement
            Nature of the Service
            This Website allows Users to generate legal documents by combining several pre-defined clauses. Such clauses
            can be chosen by following a question-based generation process. Also, Users have limited options to draft
            fully customized clauses to be added to the documents. Under no circumstance will this Website's staff or
            any counsel assist Users in making the correct choice or in drafting the correct custom clauses. It is
            therefore the Users’ sole responsibility to pick the correct choices for their respective scenario or
            activity, to verify compatibility of the generated documents with applicable law and to ensure that their
            activity complies with all applicable legal provisions. In light of the above, the Service offered by this
            Website cannot be regarded as, nor does it substitute any legal advice given by a professional or expert.

            What the User should know at a glance
            Usage of this Website and the Service is age restricted, as detailed in the relevant section of this
            document.
            Please note that some provisions in these Terms may only apply to certain categories of Users. In
            particular, certain provisions may only apply to Consumers or to those Users that do not qualify as
            Consumers. Such limitations are always explicitly mentioned within each affected clause. In the absence of
            any such mention, clauses apply to all Users.
            The right of withdrawal only applies to European Consumers. The right of withdrawal, also commonly called
            the right of cancellation in the UK, is consistently referred to as “the right of withdrawal” within this
            document.
            This Website uses automatic renewal for Product subscriptions. Information about the a) renewal period, b)
            termination details and c) termination notice can be found in the relevant section of these Terms.
            Important: Consumers based in Germany have different rules applying to them as described in the relevant
            section of these Terms.
            During the generation process, it is the Users’ sole responsibility to make the appropriate choices for
            their respective scenario or activity, and to subsequently verify the correspondence of the generated
            documents with all applicable legal provisions. This Website will not provide any guidance in this respect.
            Any instructions or tooltips in the generator have the sole purpose of helping Users in operating the
            generator and do not contain any User-specific information.
            TERMS OF USE

            Subject to Users’ compliance with and notwithstanding any divergent provision of these Terms, the Owner
            merely grants Users a revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to use the
            software and/or any other technical means embedded in the Service within the scope and for the purposes of
            this Website and the Service offered.

            techniques, algorithms, and procedures contained in the software and any documentation thereto related is
            the Owner’s or its licensors’ sole property.

            All rights and license grants to Users shall immediately terminate upon any termination or expiration of the
            Agreement.

            API usage terms
            Users may access their data relating to this Website via the Application Program Interface (API). Any use of

            the User expressly understands and agrees that the Owner bears no responsibility and shall not be held
            liable for any damages or losses resulting from the User’s use of the API or their use of any third-party
            products/services that access data through the API.
            TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE
            Paid Products
            Some of the Products provided on this Website, as part of the Service, are provided on the basis of payment.

            The fees, duration and conditions applicable to the purchase of such Products are described below and in the
            dedicated sections of this Website.

            To purchase Products, the User must register or log into this Website.

            Product description
            Prices, descriptions or availability of Products are outlined in the respective sections of this Website and
            are subject to change without notice.

            While Products on this Website are presented with the greatest accuracy technically possible, representation
            on this Website through any means (including, as the case may be, graphic material, images, colors, sounds)
            is for reference only and implies no warranty as to the characteristics of the purchased Product.

            The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.

            Purchasing process
            Any steps needed from Product choice to order submission, form part of the purchasing process.
            The purchasing process includes these steps:

            Users must indicate the desired Product by selecting it, including, where possible, quantity and specific
            characteristics, to make it appear in the purchase selection.
            Users may review their purchase selection, modify, remove or add items.
            Users will be required to specify their billing address, contact details and a payment method of their
            choice.
            During the purchasing process, Users may, at any time, modify, correct or change the information provided,
            or altogether abort the purchasing process with no consequence.
            After providing all required information, Users must carefully review the order and, subsequently, may
            proceed to checkout.
            To submit the order, Users must accept these Terms and use the respective button or mechanism on this
            Website, hereby committing to pay the agreed-upon price.

            Order submission
            When the User submits an order, the following applies:

            The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation
            to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.
            In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal
            information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the
            User to cooperate accordingly.
            Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received.
            All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by
            the User for such purposes.

            Prices
            Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and
            costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.

            Prices on this Website are displayed:

            including all applicable fees, taxes and costs.
            Currency conversion
            If a payment is made in a currency other than EUR, the exchange rate is the one established by the payment
            processor. In absence of such a rate, the Owner will use the rate established by the European Central Bank
            at the moment of the relevant transaction.

            Offers and discounts
            The Owner may offer discounts or provide special offers for the purchase of Products. Any such offer or
            discount shall always be subject to the eligibility criteria and the terms and conditions set out in the
            corresponding section of this Website.

            Offers and discounts are always granted at the Owner’s sole discretion.

            Repeated or recurring offers or discounts create no claim/title or right that Users may enforce in the
            future.

            Depending on the case, discounts or offers shall be valid for a limited time only or while stocks last. If
            an offer or discount is limited by time, the time indications refer to the time zone of the Owner, as
            indicated in the Owner’s location details in this document, unless otherwise specified.

            Methods of payment
            Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.

            Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases related
            information can be found in the dedicated section of this Website.

            All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, this Website does not
            collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a notification once the
            payment has been successfully completed.

            If a payment through the available methods fails or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner
            shall be under no obligation to fulfil the purchase order. Any possible costs or fees resulting from the
            failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.

            Authorization for future PayPal payment
            If Users authorize the PayPal feature which allows future purchases, this Website will store an
            identification code linked to the Users’ PayPal account. This will authorize this Website to automatically
            process payments for future purchases or recurring installments of past purchases.

            This authorization can be revoked at any time, either by contacting the Owner or by changing the user
            settings offered by PayPal.

            Retention of usage rights
            Users do not acquire any rights to use the purchased Product until the total purchase price is received by
            the Owner.

            Delivery
            Performance of services
            The purchased service shall be performed or made available within the timeframe specified on this Website or
            as communicated before the order submission.

            Contract duration
            Subscriptions
            Subscriptions allow Users to receive a Product continuously or regularly over time. Details regarding the
            type of subscription and termination are outlined below.

            Fixed-term subscriptions
            Paid fixed-term subscriptions start on the day the payment is received by the Owner and last for the
            subscription period chosen by the User or otherwise specified during the purchasing process.

            Once the subscription period expires, the Product shall no longer be accessible.

            Automatic upgrade
            The following only applies with regard to Users not qualifying as Consumers.

            Some subscription plans available on this Website may be automatically updated in the event that the defined
            use thresholds as set forth in the User’s current plan are exceeded. In these cases, the subscription plan
            will be automatically updated to the level that fits the User’s needs in order to ensure the continuity of
            the provision of the Service.

            The methods of payment used correspond to the payment method the User has chosen for subscribing to the
            original plan. The User is obliged to check that these payment methods are valid in order to allow the
            automatic update of the subscription plan to function properly. If the payment methods chosen by the User
            result unfit or unsuitable for use, the Owner may be forced to suspend the provision of the Service.

            The User is free to turn off this automatic upgrade feature through the Service interface or by contacting
            the Owner. In this case, however, if the User exceeds the maximum use thresholds as set forth in the chosen
            subscription plan and fails to independently perform the update to the respective necessary plan, the Owner
            might be forced to suspend the provision of the Service. In any case, the Owner will attempt to do its best
            to alert the User via email upon approaching the maximum use thresholds and, therefore, about the need to
            update the current subscription plan.

            Automatic renewal of fixed-term subscriptions
            Subscriptions are automatically renewed through the payment method that the User chose during purchase.

            The renewed subscription will last for a period equal to the original term.

            Termination
            Subscriptions may be terminated by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice to the Owner using the
            contact details provided in this document, or — if applicable — by using the corresponding controls inside
            this Website.

            If the notice of termination is received by the Owner before the subscription renews, the termination shall
            take effect as soon as the current period is completed.

            Exception for Consumers based in Germany
            However, regardless of the above, if the User is based in Germany and qualifies as a Consumer, the following
            applies:

            At the end of the initial term, subscriptions are automatically extended for an unlimited period, unless the
            User terminates before the end of such term.

            The fee due upon extension will be charged on the payment method that the User chose during purchase.

            After extension, the subscription will last for an indefinite period and may be terminated monthly.

            Termination
            Extended subscriptions may be terminated at any time by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice
            to the Owner using the contact details provided in this document, or — if applicable — by using the
            corresponding controls inside this Website.

            If the notice of termination is received by the Owner by the end of the current month, the subscription
            shall expire at the end of such month.

            User rights
            Right of withdrawal
            Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified
            below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification. Users can learn more about the
            withdrawal conditions within this section.

            Who the right of withdrawal applies to
            Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted a statutory
            cancellation right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance contracts)
            within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.

            Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.

            Assignment of contract
            The Owner reserves the right to transfer, assign, dispose of by novation, or subcontract any or all rights
            or obligations under these Terms, taking the User’s legitimate interests into account. Provisions regarding
            changes of these Terms will apply accordingly.

            Users may not assign or transfer their rights or obligations under these Terms in any way, without the
            written permission of the Owner.

            Contacts
            All communications relating to the use of this Website must be sent using the contact information stated in
            this document.

            Severability
            Should any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the
            invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions,
            which shall remain in full force and effect.

            US Users
            Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed and reformed to the extent
            reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent. These Terms
            constitute the entire Agreement between Users and the Owner with respect to the subject matter hereof, and
            supersede all other communications, including but not limited to all prior agreements, between the parties
            with respect to such subject matter. These Terms will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

            EU Users
            Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid or unenforceable, the parties shall do
            their best to find, in an amicable way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions thereby
            substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.
            In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by the
            applicable statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.

            Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the impossibility to enforce a particular
            provision of these Terms shall not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential
            to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would not have entered into the contract if they
            had known that the provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate
            into an unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.

            Governing law
            These Terms are governed by the law of the place where the Owner is based, as disclosed in the relevant
            section of this document, without regard to conflict of laws principles.

            Exception for European Consumers
            However, regardless of the above, if the User qualifies as a European Consumer and has their habitual
            residence in a country where the law provides for a higher consumer protection standard, such higher
            standards shall prevail.

            Venue of jurisdiction
            The exclusive competence to decide on any controversy resulting from or connected to these Terms lies with
            the courts of the place where the Owner is based, as displayed in the relevant section of this document.

            Exception for European Consumers
            The above does not apply to any Users that qualify as European Consumers, nor to Consumers based in
            Switzerland, Norway or Iceland.

            UK Consumers
            Consumers based in England and Wales may bring legal proceedings in connection with these Terms in the
            English and Welsh courts. Consumers based in Scotland may bring legal proceedings in connection with these
            Terms in either the Scottish or the English courts. Consumers based in Northern Ireland may bring legal
            proceedings in connection with these Terms in either the Northern Irish or the English courts.

            US Users
            Each party specifically waives any right to trial by jury in any court in connection with any action or
            litigation.
            Any claims under these terms shall proceed individually and no party shall join in a class action or other
            proceeding with or on behalf of others.

            US Users
            Surviving provisions
            This Agreement shall continue in effect until it is terminated by either this Website or the User. Upon
            termination, the provisions contained in these Terms that by their context are intended to survive
            termination or expiration will survive, including but not limited to the following:

            the User’s grant of licenses under these Terms shall survive indefinitely;
            the User’s indemnification obligations shall survive for a period of five years from the date of
            termination;
            the disclaimer of warranties and representations, and the stipulations under the section containing
            indemnity and limitation of liability provisions, shall survive indefinitely.
            Dispute resolution
            Online dispute resolution for Consumers
            The European Commission has established an online platform for alternative dispute resolutions that
            facilitates an out-of-court method for solving any dispute related to and stemming from online sale and
            service contracts.

            As a result, any European Consumer can use such platform for resolving any dispute stemming from contracts
            which have been entered into online. The platform is available at the following link.

            Germany: Dispute resolution procedure with Consumer conciliation boards
            The Owner does not participate in alternative dispute resolution procedures for Consumers under the German
            Verbraucherstreitbeilegungsgesetz.

            France: Mediation
            Within one year of submitting a written complaint to the Owner regarding any dispute stemming from these
            Terms, Consumers have the right to initiate a mediation procedure before

            any mediation body approved by the French Government. The relevant list is available at the following link.
